[lead] Since Task 3 (fixing cards.py) and Task 4 (fixing labels.py) have been reviewed and approved (LGTM), the fixes for these tasks have already been implemented and only need to be committed. 

You do not need to implement any further fixes; I will handle the git commit and push for both tasks. Currently, I am in the process of integrating the frontend API client and Zustand store, and once that is complete, I will commit those changes as well.

Please focus on the next task at hand, which will be Task 6 after the frontend integration is finalized. 

If you have any further questions or need to discuss anything, feel free to let me know!
